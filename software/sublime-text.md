**Sublime Text is a fabulous editor.**

It has an extensive plugin library that grants it similar functionality to some of the best IDE's without the same overhead.  This modular behavior leaves us with significantly faster launch times.

Additionally it provides a stunningly identical cross-platform release.

It is _"nagware"_, so if you want to avoid popups then buy a copy; it is well worth the cost.


## [installation](www.sublimetext.com/3)

Download and install the editor first (steps may vary by platform).

Next, install [package control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) so that you can install a variety of recommended packages:

- [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview)
- [SublimeCodeIntel](https://github.com/SublimeCodeIntel/SublimeCodeIntel)
- [DefaultFileType](https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-DefaultFileType)
- [EncodingHelper](https://github.com/SublimeText/EncodingHelper)
- [GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime)
- [Origami](https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami)

_The only flaw of this editor is the lack of automation support exposed through command line, which leads to manual steps to add all of the above._  Fortunately installing package control and the rest is very easy.


## configuration

Configuration is raw json and should be portable via copy and paste:

- windows: `~/AppData/Roaming/Sublime Text 3/`
- linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3/`
- osx: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/`

Mine can be found [here](../data/etc/skel/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/).
