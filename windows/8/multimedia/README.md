# Windows 8 Multimedia Platform

I use this system on a Xen server.

Its intended purpose is for Multimedia and Development, which includes watching movies, playing video games, and very basic development activities.

Because this system is intended for use on a Xen server, it has been tailored for VGA Passthrough.

**This means many of the steps I document are precautionary to prevent BSoD problems within the virtual environment.**

If you too are setting up VGA Passthrough, be sure to follow the documentation closely, and you may want to peak at Xen to be sure.
