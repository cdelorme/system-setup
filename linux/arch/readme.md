#### Updated 2-28-2014

I used arch for six months, and have decided it is not for me.

While I love simplicity I feel that their leap to systemd and subsequent lack of up to date documentation has dealt a major blow to the distros stability.

I had crashes twice a week, kernel panics randomly at boot time, and too many issues installing and configuring any major package.

While its difficult accelerated my linux growth through self-education, I am glad to no longer be using it because it was time consuming and aggrivating more often than it was pleasurable.

_I believe arch is too unstable to be useful even as a primary desktop environment, and especially as a server.  Despite having bleeding edge packages the instability it introduced made every day on it a headache._
