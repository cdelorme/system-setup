Fedora is based on RedHat linux, and uses the RPM package system.

I am significantly less familiar with the RHEL based systems, and so I expect to have much less documentation here.

Granted, my time using Fedora has only been filled with positive experiences, so I can honestly recommend this platform to anyone looking for an all-around good Linux distro.

I also can say that Fedora boasts some of the most amazing compatibility out of any linux distro, supporting Macbooks, plenty of laptops both old and new, and all the new features found on modern hardware (at least at time of writing).
