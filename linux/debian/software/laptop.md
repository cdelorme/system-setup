For a laptop user, there are a few minor changes to optimize your experience with debian.

- add `laptop-mode-tools`, `acpi-support`, and `xbacklight`
- [install or compile `connman-ui`](connman.md) to help manage connections
- switch `battery = 1` inside `~/.config/tint2/tint2rc`

There may be additional steps necessary to optimize laptop power behavior, but since I don't use linux on a laptop I won't cover that here.
